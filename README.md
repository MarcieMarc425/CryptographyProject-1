# Cryptography Project 1

### Project Description

This cryptanalysis project consists of a software implementation of an algorithm that tries to decrypt an L-symbol challenge ciphertext computed using a specific cipher. Informally speaking, the program's goal is to find the plaintext used to compute this ciphertext within a reasonable amount of time. Specifically, the program should print on screen something like "Enter the ciphertext:", obtain the ciphertext from stdin, apply some cryptanalysis strategy and output on screen something like "My plaintext guess is:" followed by the plaintext found by the strategy. 

In doing that, the program is allowed access to:
1. The ciphertext (to be taken as input from stdin)
2. A plaintext dictionary (to be posted on top of this web page), containing a number q of plaintexts, each one obtained as a sequence of space-separated words from the English dictionary
3. Partial knowledge of the encryption algorithm used (to be described below)

The program is not allowed access to:
1. The key used by the permutation cipher
2. Part of the encryption scheme (to be detailed below)

The plaintext is a space-separated sequence of words from the English dictionary (the sentence may not be meaningful, for sake of simplicity). The key is a map from each English alphabet (lower-case) letter (including <space>) to a list of numbers randomly chosen between 0 and 105, where the length of this list is the (rounded) letter’s frequency in English text, as defined in the table below. The ciphertext looks like a sequence of comma-separated numbers between 0 and 105, obtained as a sequence of encryptions of words, where each word is encrypted as a comma-separated list of numbers between 0 and 105, and these numbers are computed using the table below.

| English letters | Average frequency | Key values (randomly chosen distinct numbers between 0 and 105) |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| space | 19 |  k('space', 1), ..., k('space', 19) |
| a | 7 | k(a, 1), ..., k(a, 7) |
| c | 1 | k(b, 1) |
| b | 2 | k(c, 1),k(c, 2) |
| d | 4 | k(d, 1), ..., k(d, 4) |
| e | 10 | k(e, 1), ..., k(e, 10) |
| f | 2 | ... |
| g | 2 | |
| h | 5 | |
| i | 6 | |
| j | 1 | |
| k | 1 | |
| l | 3 | |
| m | 2 | |
| n | 6 | |
| o | 6 | |
| p | 2 | |
| q | 1 | |
| r | 5 | |
| s | 5 | |
| t | 7 | |
| u | 2 | |
| v | 1 | |
| w | 2 | |
| x | 1 | |
| y | 2 | |
| z | 1 | |

The cipher works as follows. It takes as input a plaintext from a message space and a key randomly chosen from a key space and returns a ciphertext.

- The message space is the set {<space>,a,..,z}^L. In other words the message m can be written as m[1]...m[L], where each m[i] belongs to set {(space>,a,..,z}
- The ciphertext c can be written as c[1],...,c[L], where each c[i] belongs to set {0,..,105}. To avoid ambiguities, cyphertext symbols are separated by a comma.
- The key space is the set of random maps from {0,..,26} to a permutation of all numbers in {0,…,105}, grouped in 27 lists, each list having length determined by column 2 of the table below.
- The encryption algorithm works as follows. For each message character m[j], the algorithm finds m[j] in column 1 of the table below, and returns one of the keys in column 3 of the same row. The computation of which key is returned by the algorithm is based on a scheduling algorithm which is intentionally left unknown and is a deterministic algorithm (that is, it does not use new random bits) that may depend on j, L and the length of the list on that row.
- The decryption algorithm does the inverse process. On input a ciphertext character, it finds the ciphertext character in column 3 of the table, and returns the column 1 plaintext letter (possibly including <space>) that is on the same row.
  
For instance, assume k(<space>,1)=76,...,k(<space>,19)=94, k(b,1)=23, k(c,1)=11, k(c,2)=98, k(g,1)=34, k(g,2)=56. Then the plaintext “cbcb gbgg gcb” may be encrypted as “98,23,11,23,79,34,23,56,34,82,34,11,23”. (Just for simplicity, in this example the plaintext was not a sequence of English words). The program will be scored based on two tests.
  
In the first test, the program will be run many times, each time on a new ciphertext, computed using the above encryption scheme and a plaintext randomly chosen from the plaintext dictionary, with a different scheduling algorithm. On the first execution, the scheduling algorithm will compute “j mod length(list)” and use this result to select the element of that position in the list. On the other executions, the scheduling algorithms will be more and more complex variations of this one. In this test we will likely choose L=500, and a plaintext dictionary with q=5 plaintexts.

In the second test, the program will be run a few times, each time on a new ciphertext, computed using a plaintext obtained as a space-separate sequence of words that are randomly chosen from a subset of the set of all English words (specifically, a few words taken from the attachment english_words.txt at the top of this page, to be published soon) and the above encryption scheme, with a different scheduling algorithm. In this test we will likely choose L=500.

Upon execution, it should obtain the ciphertext from stdin, and finally return the output plaintext on stdout within x minutes (or else it will be declared to default to an incorrect guess); most likely, we will choose x = 1 on test 1 and x = 3 on test 2.
